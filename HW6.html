	<h2 align=left>BACKGROUND</h2>
	<p>
	SITE or <em> Sculpture In The Environment </em> was an architecture firm in the 1970s known for their design of the <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Best_Products">BEST Stores</a>, an early big-box store.

	<p>
	The principals of SITE came from varied backgrounds, including:

	<p>
	<table style="margin-left: 100px;">
	  <tr><th>Member</th><th>Background</th></tr>
		<tr><td>James Wines</td><td>Architect</td></tr>
	  <tr><td>Edward Lear</td><td>Poet</td></tr>
	  <tr><td>Patricia C Phillips</td><td>Writer</td></tr>
	  <tr><td>Philip Jodidio</td><td>Engineer</td></tr>
	</table>

	<p>
	<div id="Postmodernism">
	<h3 align=left>POSTMODERNISM</h2>
	<p>
	Postmodernism is an architectural movement that gained prominence during the 1970s.  It features minimal forms with a return to ornamentation, typically used in a more abstract and over-the-top way.

	<p>
	<div id="BEST_Stores">
  <h4 align=left>BEST STORES</h4>
  The Best Stores were an early big-box retail store designed by SITE.  Each store was completely unique, intended to be eye-catching and distinctive. This design features part of the facade torn away and re-established in the midst of the parking lot, giving the impression that the store is moving and is a dynamic creature.  Note the sliding glass doors planted in the parking lot islands.

  <p>
	<div id="Other_Works">
	<h5 align=left>OTHER WORKS</h4>
	SITE designed many other structures, many of which were never built.  One, the noteworthy "High Rise Homes," features a platform system upon which individuals can build their own designs, creating a vertical town.  Ultimately, SITE seeks to create structures that overcome the constraint of being architecture, and become art that also happens to function, hence the name: Sculpture in the Environment.
